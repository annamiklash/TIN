            <p class="text">Launched in 1973, Volkswagen spent years marketing the Passat under names like Dasher and
                Quantum in the U.S. But no matter what the company called it, the Passat has been a huge seller around
                the
                world. Larger and more luxurious than the Jetta, the Passat wasn’t the sales success known and loved
                today
                until Ferdinand Piech, former chairman of the Volkswagen Group, got his hands on it. Its refined, solid
                construction, strong engines, and classy styling are what set it apart. </p>
