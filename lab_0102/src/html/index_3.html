        Vincent van Gogh painted Starry Night in 1889 during his stay at the asylum of Saint-Paul-de-Mausole near
        Saint-Rémy-de-Provence. Van Gogh lived well in the hospital; he was allowed more freedoms than any of the other
        patients. If attended, he could leave the hospital grounds; he was allowed to paint, read, and withdraw into his
        own room. He was even given a studio. While he suffered from the occasional relapse into paranoia and fits -
        officially he had been diagnosed with epileptic fits - it seemed his mental health was recovering.
        Unfortunately, he relapsed. He began to suffer hallucination and have thoughts of suicide as he plunged into
        depression. Accordingly, there was a tonal shift in his work. He returned to incorporating the darker colors
        from the beginning of his career and Starry Night is a wonderful example of that shift. Blue dominates the
        painting, blending hills into the sky. The little village lays at the base in the painting in browns, greys, and
        blues. Even though each building is clearly outlined in black, the yellow and white of the stars and the moon
        stand out against the sky, drawing the eyes to the sky. They are the big attention grabber of the painting.

    <p class="text">
        The Potato Eaters, completed in 1885, is considered by many to be Van Gogh's first great work of art. At the
        time of its creation, Van Gogh had only recently started painting and had not yet mastered the techniques that
        would later make him famous. This could attribute to the interesting look of the piece as well as the overall
        feeling produced from the painting.
        Van Gogh wished to create his first masterpiece that could boost his reputation as a developed artist; his goal
        was to paint human figures that did not appear to be awkward, but rather existing naturally. Portraying the
        figures in a dark room with light from an oil lamp, however, proved to be a bit too extreme for his newly
        acquired artistic skills. The outcome of all of these factors, in turn, made the painting more appreciated in
        the art community then if Van Gogh had succeeded in his original task. </p>

    <h2>Almond Blossoms</h2>

    <p class="text">
        Van Gogh’s life was full of new starts, changes of scenery, and ideas of things getting better. Often he would
        start something new convinced that once it worked out everything would be right. In early 1890, Vincent’s
        brother Theo had a son. Vincent was in great spirits saying “How glad I was when the news came.” He reluctantly
        accepted the honor of having the new child named Vincent, after himself, and became the child’s godfather.
        When Vincent moved to Arles, he dreamed of a new beginning where artists lived together and painted happily. At
        the Saint Paul Asylum in Saint-Remy, he thought he would get better after a year and be able to continue his
        life with new found success and happiness, and then with the birth of his nephew, he saw a new life to be
        celebrated. Immediately after finding about the healthy birth he began on a painting for the baby – Blossoming
        Almond Tree. He wanted it to be hung above the bed in the parents’ and child’s room. Indeed, speaking of the
        child his brother’s wife wrote “He always looks with very great interest at Uncle Vincent’s paintings.” Van Gogh
        must have been very proud and filled with joy when thinking about his budding relationship with his nephew.
